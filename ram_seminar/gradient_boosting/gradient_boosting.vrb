\frametitle{Pseudocode}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Algorithm}{see pseudocode here} \par
What to tell:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Learning rate. It's called shrinkage sometimes (like one other thing).
	\item Line search (from wiki pseudocode) sucks.
	\item Gradient boosting is an inferior approximation of simple boosting.
	\item Greedy trees.
	\item Other score functions (like 'mae' in sklearn) are strange.
\end{itemize}
